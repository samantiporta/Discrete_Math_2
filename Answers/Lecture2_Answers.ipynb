    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This proof shows that the expected value (average outcome) of a multinomial distribution is the product of the number of trials (n) and the probability of success for a specific category (p_i).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expected Value Definition:**\n",
    "    * We know the expected value (E[y]) is the sum of each outcome (y) multiplied by its probability (P(y)):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E[y] = \\sum y \\cdot P(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Joint Probability Distribution:**\n",
    "    * The provided joint probability distribution (P(y)) considers the number of trials in each category (y_i) and the individual probabilities (P_i) for each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$P(y) = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} P_1^{y_1} P_2^{y_2} P_3^{y_3}....P_n^{y_n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n",
    "    * We can rewrite the expected value as a sum of terms, each considering the product of the number of trials in a category (y_i) and its individual probability (P_i):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E[y] = \\sum (y_1 \\cdot P_1 + y_2 \\cdot P_2 + y_3 \\cdot P_3 + \\dotsb + y_n \\cdot P_n) \\cdot \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extracting a Common Factor:**\n",
    "    * Each term in the sum has the product (n!) of all trials as a factor. We can rewrite this product to include only the specific category's trials (y_i!):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E[y] = \\sum \\left( y_1 \\cdot \\frac{n!}{y_1!} \\cdot P_1^{y_1} \\cdot P_2^{y_2} \\cdot P_3^{y_3} \\dotsb P_n^{y_n} + \\dotsb + y_n \\cdot \\frac{n!}{y_n!} \\cdot P_1^{y_1} \\cdot P_2^{y_2} \\cdot P_3^{y_3} \\dotsb P_n^{y_n} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Summing Across Categories:**\n",
    "    * The summation across all categories essentially adds up the expected outcomes for each category, resulting in n times the sum of individual probabilities (p_i):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E[y] = \\sum \\left( n \\cdot P_1^{y_1} \\cdot P_2^{y_2} \\cdot P_3^{y_3} \\dotsb P_n^{y_n} \\right) = n \\cdot \\left( P_1^1 + P_2^2 + P_3^3 + \\dotsb + P_n^n \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Leveraging the Property of Probabilities:**\n",
    "    * Since the sum of probabilities across all categories equals 1 (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n = 1), the final step simplifies the expected value to n * 1, which is n * p_i:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E[y] = n \\cdot (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \\dotsb + p_n) = n \\cdot 1 = n \\cdot p_i$$\n",
